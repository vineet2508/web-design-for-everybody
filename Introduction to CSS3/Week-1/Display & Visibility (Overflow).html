	So one of the things you may have noticed as you've been going through other code is that sometimes when you mess with the height and the width of an element. You find out that it no longer is big enough to hold all the text that you wanted to show. So, what can you do when the content doesn't fit any longer inside the box that you've made with your height and widt.	Well, you can use a property overflow to determine how people are going to be able to access that content, or if they're even going to be able to access it at all.

	The four values for overflow, include visible, which basically means if you've drawn a box. And there's a whole bunch of text inside of it, the text is actually gonna go outside the box. So no matter what, the content is visible even if it goes outside the lines.
